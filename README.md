# Toy Land BD

Toy Land BD in the website where I have added some data from mongodb in category section, in feedback section, also I created two private route My toys and Add a toys.

## How this websites works [step by step]

(1) There are five route in the navbar, Homepage, All Toys, and blog are open route

(2) In the homepage, I displaied some data category wise. I loaded data from mongodb. If any user wants to see details of single item he/she have to login first after login the authentication system will automatically redirect him to the exact item page

(3) There are two private routes. when a user will login in the website he will see my toys and add a toys page. he can add a toy and will be displayed in my toys page also it will be displayed in all toys page. But in my toys page I show only the exact user who added the item. other user data he will cannot be seen in my toys page.

(4) Add a toy page, in this page user will be able to add the item.

(5) My Toys page I added some functionalities such as updating the item and deleting the item, also there is a functionality by which he will be able to see the item in hight price rate and low price rate sorting.

(6) All toys page: In this page any user can see all the items without login but anyone want to see the items details. he have to login in first. Also, I add pagination functionality. I loaded all data from mongoDB. In the backend I write all the functionality of all APIs.

(7) Some technologies I added there are: swipper js, react slick, react sweet alert, react icons, custom hook for dynamic title, node.js, mongodb, express js, pagination and react-router-dom.
